1. Project Overview

This project analyzes global youth unemployment trends using MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Charts.
The objective is to visually explore how youth unemployment varies across countries, regions and time.
All visualizations were created in MongoDB Charts and combined into a single interactive dashboard.
This submission corresponds to Project B of the DBMS coursework.

2. Dataset Used

Dataset: Global Youth Unemployment Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Format: CSV
Total Rows: Approximately 17,000
Columns:

Country

CountryCode

Year

YouthUnemployment

The dataset provides annual youth unemployment percentages for a large set of countries.

3. Steps Followed

Step 1: A MongoDB Atlas cluster was created.
Step 2: The CSV dataset was imported into a database named "global_unemployment" with a collection named "youth_unemployment".
Step 3: The Atlas database was connected to MongoDB Charts.
Step 4: Multiple visualizations were created based on different analytical questions.
Step 5: All charts were organized into a single dashboard, which was made public.
